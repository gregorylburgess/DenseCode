Decompressor of Plain Huffman (PH)

Permits to decompress a file compressed with PH

Syntax: decPH <compressedFile> <OutputFile>


Notes: 
 
 - Two files "compressedFile" and "compressedFile.voc" should be in the same folder, otherwise decompression will fail.
 
 - A file "timesDecPH" is also created after decompression. It logs decompression times (useful to perform several runs of the decompressor and then collect all the time measures).
