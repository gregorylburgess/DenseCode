/* Removes '\0' characters from a input file --

Parses a text file and computes the different words in it.
Then, it applies a filter by frequency of word and/or the lenght
of the words, in such a way that only the "filtered words" are
output to the target file.

This target file is useful since it contains a set of patterns that
can be later searched inside the input text file.
